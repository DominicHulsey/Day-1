    <h1>Hello, world</h1>
    <p>My name is Dominic.</p>
    <p>What I did before codeworks:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Graduated from the College of Idaho with Bachelor's degrees
            in Business and Political Economy</li>
        <li>Worked as a camp counselor for local basketball camps all throughout college</li>
        <li>Developed and maintained a website for Legacy Charter school while in high school</li>
        <li>interned at Northwestern Mutual as a financial representative during college</li>
        <li>Worked as an Inventory Management associate at Walmart for a couple summers</li>
    </ul>

    <p>What I hope to get out of this course:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Learn the basics steps that I need to know in order
            to turn a project idea into a fully working application.</li>
        <li>Gain the skills I need to be an employable Junior Developer.</li>
        <li>Network with local developers, learn more about what the lifestyle is like
            as well as what the job environment is like in the Boise area.</li>
        <li>Build at least one application that is useful to me beyond just being a part of my portfolio.</li>
        <li>Build lasting relationships with my classmates. I want to grow network of people
            that I know who love development that I can relate to and grow with. </li>
    </ul>
    <p>Things I enjoy:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>I've always loved basketball. I started playing in elementary school,
            played for my high school/college teams, and still play today.</li>
        <li>Huge Lakers fan; my family lived in Anaheim, California before moving to Idaho so
            I grew up watching them.
        </li>
        <li>I enjoy playing video games with friends, lately i've been playing Super Smash Bros.
            Ultimate, Red Dead Redemption 2, and Fortnite.</li>
        <Li>I love traveling. I've taken trips to a few countries outside the U.S. (Mexico, Canada, Spain, France) and
            hope to
            add many more to that list in the future.
        </Li>
